# TypeAuthD
Discord authentication service primarily created for SS14, but could be used with another applications. Supports 2 database providers and SSL out of the box.

TypeAuthD is a TypeScript rewrite of my previous [ssj_auth](https://github.com/JerryImMouse/ssj_auth) for SS14. This version offers broader functionality and improved structure, making it easier to maintain and update. (The name is still a work in progress)

This application serves as an improved version of the original [ssj_auth](https://github.com/JerryImMouse/ssj_auth), with a focus on better maintainability, scalability, and more predictable behavior cause of typescript.

## Quickstart
Create discord application at [Discord Developer Portal](), copy **CLIENT_ID** and **CLIENT_SECRET** at OAuth2 page.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/JerryImMouse/typeauthd.git
cd typeauthd

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build sources
npm run build
```

Then you'll need to setup configuration. You can use `appconfig.min.jsonc`, but you had to remove comments inside and rename it to `appconfig.json`.

After that add your **CLIENT_ID** and **CLIENT_SECRET** into configuration and run the service with:

```bash
npm start
```

Now you can use **Postman**, **Bruno** or some other application to test your new authorization service.
